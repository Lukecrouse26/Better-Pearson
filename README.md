# Better-Pearson
Better Pearson is a project to improve upon the Pearson math idea by instead of taking direct input on the client, it will use image uploading to upload an image of handwritten math and process that in order to get credit for work done as well as the answer and be able to get instant direct feedback on where you went wrong.
